          The Sedin twins had announced that they plan to leave Hockey and retire come the end of this season, it's sad to see them go but they'll be leaving with their own extensive list of achievments.

          Both Sedins are two out of 87 players to have a point total of over a thousand, which was gained over a 17 season period. Both have an Art Ross Trophy, with Henrik getting it in the 2009-2010 season along with the Hart Trophy and Daniel getting the Art
          Ross Trophy the year after along with a Ted Lindsay Trophy.

          The Sedins were amazing players and are held as the best NHL twins to ever grace the arena. On their second to last home game, they recieved standing ovations from the Canucks fans in the crowd and cheered no matter what the Sedin twins were doing at the moment, many held up signs to show how much the Sedins mean to Vancouver and the Canucks.
