    <h2>Vancouver</h2>
    <p>Is the biggest port in Canada, the most densely populated city in Canada and one of thhe most densely<br>
    populated cities in <strong>North America</strong>, so there has to be something to do there right?<br>Well 
    you're in luck, here are five fantastic things to explore and do while visiting!</p>
    <div id=capilano>
      <li><strong><h2>Capilano Suspension Bridge Park</h2></strong></li>
      <p>Walk across canyons, explore forests, look out into the rushing water below, pretend to be an ewok on little<br> 
      tree platforms and more. Here you can play games located across the main bridge <br>
      (<em>which was built in 1899 and measures 460 ft long and 230 ft above the river</em>)<br>
      and explore the beauty of the temperate rainforest. If you decide to come in the winter, you get to see their<br>
      canyon lights as you explore the park, and take a look off of a cliffside view as you're suspended in mid-air<br>
      on the cliffwalk. (<strong>Just be careful, its very high up</strong>)</p><br><br>
